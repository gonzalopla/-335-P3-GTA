------------------------------------------------------------

How to handle the 335-p3-gta files to get results:

1. Main HTML file is index, a web page.
2. Sibling folder (at same level as .html) is "mergesort", "quicksort" and "selectionsort".
  (You can move these files elsewhere if you change index.html accordingly.)
3. Web page links to (loads) styles.css
4. Web page has some HTML markup for title, header and text.
5. After body, web page loads three script files one called "mergesort" another "quicksort" and the last selectionsort with fcns.
6. After that, another Script section defines another function.
7. And then runs some "loose" Javascript commands.

How to show (and run) the web page:
8. Drag and drop the html file onto a browser to see what it does.

(*) Key: use fcn key F12 to open a "javascript console" in your browser
and see what might be going wrong: errors and warnings.
